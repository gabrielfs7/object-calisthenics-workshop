# Rule 8: No classes with more than two instance variables

This rule is really hard to follow and __SHOULD__ be adapted to your team/organization. 
It is important to set a limit of instances since it promotes higher cohesion, and better encapsulation.

It can be achieved using help of the [Rule 3: Wrap All Primitives And Strings](../Rule3) and using __Value Objects__.
